/**
 * Pure state-machine helpers for the wizard. Extracted from WizardApp.tsx so the
 * transitions can be unit-tested without rendering ink.
 *
 * Bug fix (2026-06): credentials moved BEFORE generate so:
 *   1. Bad creds (401/403) are caught upfront — before the operator pays the cost
 *      of extract + LLM classification (potentially many minutes).
 *   2. Live preview in final-review actually fires, because the validated creds
 *      are present in WizardApp state when GenerateReviewStep mounts.
 *
 * New order:
 *   welcome → token-input → path-validation → extracting → scope-gate
 *          → credentials (validates inline) → generating
 *          → generating → final-review → push-decision-gate → previewing
 *          → preview-gate → pushing → done
 *
 * `--no-push` short-circuits the credentials/preview/push branch — the operator
 * just wants extract + classify + final-review without ever touching Contentful.

 * Bug fix (2026-07): the `generation_cache` table in pipeline.db is keyed by

 * fresh new session on an unchanged codebase always hits the cache and
 * silently skips the LLM. That's the intended behavior for continued sessions
 * (modify / push-from-run) but is surprising for a fresh `experiences import`
 * run: the operator expects a re-classify pass, not cached output from a
 * prior session.
 *
 * Resolution: for a fresh session (no `seedExtractSessionId`), force
 * `--no-cache` on the spawned `generate components` subprocess. For a
 * continued session (modify / push-from-run / picker-seeded), honor the
 * operator's `--no-cache` flag as before.
